Hello there, this is kendell andrews and I created the name NeuroForward

This website allows professionals to have clients book an appointment with them from the website. In this example we will use Life Coachs. 

The stack I used for this project is: react, express, node, axios to send request to db.json

When we open the site we land on this page that welcomes us. 

The home page is spaced with sections, divs, headers and other tags so they can be easily customized later.

At the top we have a nav bar. 

As we scroll we find more information about the business. Sections allow us to display different types of content on the same page.

at the bottom we have a text paragraph and a header that says to click the brain for availability.

Clicking the brain takes us to that page. 

Here we have a form and a couple buttons.

The top button will display an alert telling us what times have been booked.

We can then fill out the form to submit out appointment request.

The appointment time is a dropdown with options available.

The submit button will add it to the array of booked appointments.

If we check the booked appointments again we will see there is another appointment it is alerting us about. 

We also have other pages for Contact and About us.
